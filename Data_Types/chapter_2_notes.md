# Chapter - 2(Variables and Simple Data Types)

## Variables
  1. Variables are labels (not containers to store values). They are references to values stores in memory
  2. Naming Conventions for Python
	- Can contain only letters, numbers, or underscores.
	- They can start with only a letter or underscore
	- spaces are not allowed

*What is a Traceback?*
- record of where the interpreter ran into a a trouble while executing your code

What is a Name Error?
- Using a variable name before setting it or misspelling a variable's name


## Strings
- Commmon Methods
	1. `title()`
	2. `upper()`
	3. `lower()`
	4. `removesuffix()`
	5. `removeprefix()`
	5. `strip(), lstrip(), rstrip()`

### How to use Variables in Strings?
- using `f-strings`

- Add whitespace using `\n` and `\t`

## Numbers

- Python calls any number with a decimal as *float*
- Python defaults to *float* in any operation that uses a float, even if the output is a whole number
- when writing long numbers, use `_` for better readability like `14_0000_000`
- Python doesn't have built-in CONSTANT TYPES, but programmers use CAPITAL CASE to represent CONSTANTS
```
0.2 + 0.1

```
what's the result ??? - why that happens??

## Comments

What kind of comments one should write ??

- When you’re deciding whether to write a comment, ask yourself if you had to consider several approaches before coming up with a reasonable way to make something work; 
- if so, write a comment about your solution. It’s much easier to delete extra comments later than to go back and write comments for a sparsely commented program.

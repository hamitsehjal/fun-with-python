# Taking User Input

- use `input()` function
- use `int()` to accept *numerical inputs*
- modulo operator `%`

## While Loops
Control the flow of the `while loops`
Three ways:
1. using a `Flag`
2. Using a `break` statement - exit the *loop* immediately
3. using a `continue` statement - return to the beginning of the loop

## Using a `while` loop with *lists* and *Dictionaries*
- Never MODIFY a list inside a `for` loop. Why? read below: 
- A for loop is effective for looping through a list, but you shouldnâ€™t modify a list inside a for loop because Python will have trouble keeping track of the items in the list.
- To modify a list as you work through it, use a while loop. Using while loops with lists and dictionaries allows you to collect, store, and organize lots of input to examine and report on later.
